# LTEBS_2021_II_GROUP_09_EAGLE
21.03.21
  1.TMUX has been modified because there was an error in the schematic found on beep, the official datasheet from texas instruments https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmux1208.pdf?ts=1615825592091 layout has been assumed.
  2.assignment1_LBR.lbr shows some discordances in the layers usage (tname layer should be used for names as well as tvalue for values), the symbol has been centered.
(there is some confusion in the log on march 21, I uploaded the version directly on main, wrongly. Everything should be ok now)
